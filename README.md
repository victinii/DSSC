# DSSC
This paper focuses on the field of image style transfer. Traditional methods are afflicted with inaccurate embedding of style images, tend to extract not only the artistic style from the style images but also mix color information. This often results in the generated images maintaining the color of the style images, especially when only one style image is available, thus compromising the intended style transfer effect.

To address these problems, we propose a novel method called DSSC (Denoising Style Stepwise Control). DSSC introduces multiple style codes to sequentially guide the denoising process in diffusion models, ensuring accurate transfer of artistic style. Our approach provides a robust solution that enhances the aesthetic quality and precision of style embedding in generated images.

The code of DSSC will be available soon.
